# Inpainting Mars orbital image (HiRISE) data set 

The original dataset: [Mars orbital image (HiRISE) labeled data set version 3](https://zenodo.org/records/2538136)

There are incomplete regions in the Hirise version 3 dataset, which is probably due to map projection or the low bandwidth. 

To address this issue, we propose a model called Partial-Net for filling in missing satellite image data. Our paper can be obtained from [Waiting for updates]()

The original data is classified into two categories: images with more than 20 black pixels are categorized as damaged, while those with 20 or fewer black pixels are classified as intact.  We provide the corresponding filelist. Base on our Partial-Net, we have completed the restoration of all missing data regions in Mars orbital image (HiRISE) labeled data set version 3. Furthermore, we create a mask set to imitate Mars particular gap areas. Above all can be obtained from [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1W9gNZDXw8phZYiNvlfdsZQ). (Code: aa4h)
